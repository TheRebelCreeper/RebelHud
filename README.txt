My TF2 HUD

How to install: 
Drag the folder called custom to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf\

You can also just double click on the installer.

Enable captions:
Put these lines in your autoexec file
cc_lang "rebel"
closecaption "1"

A large part of this HUD comes from PVHUD. I did not create PVHUD, only modified it where I felt it was needed.
